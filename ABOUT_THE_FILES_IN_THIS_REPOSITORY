ABOUT FILES




Hi



So the preprocessor is in crystal.  I want to port it to C.


The other file copies code from manpages to ones clipboard, for pasting to a C/C++ program


It's written in c so it's really fast



For example, if the program is called "c"


c read

would copy the ERRNOs from the read() syscall to ones clipboard.


There would be case statements for every errno.



I WANT TO HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF THIS PROJECT. THEN I WILL FIX CODE FORMATTING AND LITTLE THINGS
