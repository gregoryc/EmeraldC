I have named this project and I have made a github for it.

I am looking for people to have a discussion about the direction of this.


After that, code formatting and things like that can be fixed.


What functions would you like to add to make this language even better?


String handling is a big problem for C. I handled that.


It would be nice to have 1) backticks like ruby or bash 2) blocks like ruby or crystal

3) (So one could do something like Thread.new {

........


}) in C





4) Maybe I can add list comprehensions? That would be cool.
5) I want to have good gsub variants



These are 5 things we have yet to implement.


What other methods would you guys like?


The source code is one file of 437 lines of Crystal code.


It is not hard to fork or modify.

There are no classes or anything complicated.
